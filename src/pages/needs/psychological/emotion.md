## Factors

Emotional needs vary from person to person depending on personal differences including:

- Personality type
- Medical mental conditions
- Medications

The personality trait of extraversion is often associated with high levels of positive affectivity and positive emotion, whereas introversion may have the reverse effect. There are also several brain disorders that cause decreased positive affect and positive emotion, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar. Similarly, medications that treat mental conditions such as those brain disorders often are intended to significantly alter a person's affectivity and emotions. These are among some of the personal factors that are important to be aware of and understand the implications of.
