## Measurement

## Factors

Relationship needs vary from person to person depending on personal differences including:

- Personality type
- Personal life events
  - Number of stressors
  - Intensity of stressors

## Ideals

Ideally every human should

- Have at least 2–3 close, dependable, positive relationships with other people
- Feel well-connected and satisfied with personal relationships
- Have a sense of community, belonging, and social connection
- Understand personal relationship needs
- Track relationship needs weekly and/or monthly
- Fulfill personal relationship needs
  - Regularly connect with other people
  - Regularly develop close relationships
- Set weekly and/or monthly goals based on personal needs
  - Build and maintain healthy, dependable relationships and connections

### Consider your needs

Consider how many close, positive relationships you need and how often you need to spend time connecting with others to feel connected, supported, and content. At a base human level, everyone needs at least 2–3 dependable relationships and should connect with others at least every other day. Personal factors that might contribute to a greater need for close relationships and connection are an extroverted personality type or significantly stressful life events and circumstances. Conversely, introversion might lead one to not need a greater quantity of close relationships beyond 2–3 nor need to spend as much time connecting with others.

### Fulfill your needs

Be intentional about setting aside the time you need to stay well-connected to the people you share close, positive relationships with or to develop new relationships, ensuring you have the healthy, dependable relationships you need.

### Track your needs

Try to measure your relationship needs weekly or at least monthly.
