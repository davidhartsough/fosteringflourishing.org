## Measurement

### Subjective measurement

While it is heavily influenced and reactive to the state and condition of one's environment, security at the individual level is only effectively measured through self-assessment questions, as it is a subjective experience, mindset, and feeling.

- Overall, I feel secure.
- I feel safe.
- I feel stable.
- I don't worry about my safety.
- I don't worry about instability.
- I don't worry about my basic needs.
- I feel physically safe and secure.
- I feel financially and economically secure.
- I live in a secure and safe environment and community.

## Ideals
