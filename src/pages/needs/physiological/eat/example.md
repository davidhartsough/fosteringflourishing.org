This example demonstrates calculating, tracking, and fulfilling [the need to eat](/needs/physiological/eat/).

## Calculating my needs

As a 25-year-old male who is 5'10", weighs 125 pounds, and is moderately active, the [USDA's Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) Calculator](https://fnic.nal.usda.gov/fnic/dri-calculator/) states that my personal nutrition needs are:

- 3.7 liters (or 16 cups) of water
- 2493 calories (10,430 kJ)
- 280–405 grams of carbohydrates
- 38 grams of fiber
- 45–64 grams of protein
- 55–97 grams of fat
- 900 mcg of vitamin A
- 90 mg of vitamin C
- 15 mcg of vitamin D
- 1.3 mg of vitamin B6
- 15 mg of vitamin E
- 120 mcg of vitamin K
- 1.2 mg of thiamin
- 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12
- 1.3 mg of riboflavin
- 400 mcg of folate
- 16 mg of niacin
- 0.55 g of choline
- 5–10 mg of pantothenic acid
- 30 mcg of biotin
- 1000 mg of calcium
- 2.3 g of chloride
- 35 mcg of chromium
- 4 mg of fluoride
- 150 mcg of iodine
- 8 mg of iron
- 400 mg of magnesium
- 2.3 mg of manganese
- 45 mcg of molybdenum
- 0.7g of phosphorus
- 4.7 g of potassium
- 55 mcg of selenium
- 1.5 g of sodium
- 11–15 mg of zinc
- 2 mg of copper

## Tracking my needs

Using [the objective measurements](/needs/physiological/eat/#objective-measurement) of nutritional needs, I try to measure the amount of nutrients that my body absorbs, based on the foods I eat throughout the day.

### Breakdown

**Calculate the amount of nutrients in each food eaten.**

I ate one bowl of pho that had approximately:

- 400 calories
- 40 grams of carbs
- 30 grams of protein
- 6 grams of fat
- 600 mg of sodium
- 4 mg of iron
- 9 mg of vitamin C
- 40 mcg of vitamin A
- 50 mg of calcium

I ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza.

- Each slice of Hawaiian pizza had approximately:
  - 250 calories
  - 35 grams of carbs
  - 11 grams of protein
  - 9 grams of fat
  - 180 mg of potassium
  - 420 mg of sodium
  - 2 mg of iron
  - 12 mg of vitamin C
  - 55 mcg of vitamin A
  - 210 mg of calcium
- Multiplied by 3, the sum nutritional value was:
  - 750 calories
  - 105 grams of carbs
  - 33 grams of protein
  - 27 grams of fat
  - 540 mg of potassium
  - 1260 mg of sodium
  - 6 mg of iron
  - 36 mg of vitamin C
  - 165 mcg of vitamin A
  - 630 mg of calcium

**Calculate the sum of nutrients consumed.**

Altogether, I absorbed approximately:

- 1.2 liters of water
- 1150 calories
- 145 grams of carbs
- 63 grams of protein
- 33 grams of fat
- 205 mcg of vitamin A
- 45 mg of vitamin C
- 680 mg of calcium
- 10 mg of iron
- 540 mg of potassium
- 1860 mg of sodium

## Fulfilling my needs

If I subtract my current nutritional fulfillment for the day from my calculated daily needs, then I know that I still need:

- 2.5 liters of water
- 1343 calories
- 135–260 grams of carbohydrates
- 38 grams of fiber
- 0 grams of protein
- 22 grams of fat
- 695 mcg of vitamin A
- 45 mg of vitamin C
- 15 mcg of vitamin D
- 1.3 mg of vitamin B6
- 15 mg of vitamin E
- 120 mcg of vitamin K
- 1.2 mg of thiamin
- 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12
- 1.3 mg of riboflavin
- 400 mcg of folate
- 16 mg of niacin
- 0.55 g of choline
- 5–10 mg of pantothenic acid
- 30 mcg of biotin
- 320 mg of calcium
- 2.3 g of chloride
- 35 mcg of chromium
- 4 mg of fluoride
- 150 mcg of iodine
- 0 mg of iron
- 400 mg of magnesium
- 2.3 mg of manganese
- 45 mcg of molybdenum
- 0.7g of phosphorus
- ~4 g of potassium
- 55 mcg of selenium
- 0 g of sodium
- 11–15 mg of zinc
- 2 mg of copper

I'm planning to make a stir fry as a final meal for the day, so I want to ensure I include foods that are rich in the nutrients I still need. I'll use brown rice, carrots, broccoli, spinach, peppers, and onions. However, even this still leaves me with a need for:

- 600 calories
- 12 grams of carbohydrates
- 25 grams of fiber
- 150 mcg of vitamin A
- 4 mg of vitamin C
- 2.4 mcg of vitamin B-12
- 12 mg of vitamin E
- 15 mcg of vitamin D
- 28 mcg of vitamin K
- 250 mg of calcium
- 2 mg of potassium

### Setting goals

Given my nutritional deficit, I know that my eating pattern is not sustainable in the long run for healthy eating and the fulfillment of my needs. Tomorrow I will need to make up for this deficit of nutritional value by eating higher calorie meals that incorporate more carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, calcium, and potassium. Furthermore, I consumed nearly 1000 mg of sodium more than I needed, so I should limit my sodium intake tomorrow.

### Building patterns and habits

Over the course of the week, I will strive to keep track of which foods and meals were most nutritious and incorporate them into a regular diet.
