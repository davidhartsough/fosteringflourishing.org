## Measuring

Subjective measures include the following self-assessment questions:

- Overall, I have been contributing to something I care about.
- I have been giving time and effort to someone or something significant to me.
- I have been helping something or someone meaningful to me.
- I have been having an impact on something.
- I have been making a difference.
- I feel as though my time and efforts are contributing to something worthwhile.
- I have been proud of my contributions.
- I have been helping something advance, develop, and progress.

## Tracking

Try to measure your contribution weekly or at least monthly.

[// Use the Fostering Flourishing tool (not made yet)](#/)

- Have an impact and make a difference
- Understand personal potential for contribution
- Track contribution weekly and/or monthly
- Set weekly and/or monthly goals based on personal potential
