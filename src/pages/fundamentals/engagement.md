## Definition

- To engage deeply in a constructive activity
- To be in a state of flow
- To be absorbed in the present moment

### Components

Flow can be described as having 6 primary components:

- Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
- Merging of action and awareness
- A loss of reflective self-consciousness
- A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
- A distortion of temporal experience in which one's subjective experience of time is altered
- Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience

## Effects

Regular engagement and flow has notable effects on one's brain in relation to flourishing.

- I can easily enter a state of flow.
- I can easily stay engaged.

- I am often losing my sense of time and self-awareness while doing something I enjoy.
- I am often able to focus all my attention and concentration in the present moment and activity.
- I often feel a sense of control and agency when deeply immersed in an activity.
